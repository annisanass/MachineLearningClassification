This project demonstrates the classification of the Iris dataset using Logistic Regression. The Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning, contains 150 samples divided equally among three classes: Iris-Setosa, Iris-Versicolor, and Iris-Virginica. Each sample includes four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

The project begins with data collection and preparation. The Iris dataset is loaded using Scikit-learn and converted into Pandas DataFrames for easier manipulation. Following this, an exploratory data analysis (EDA) is performed. Basic information about the dataset is reviewed using methods such as displaying the first few rows, checking data types and statistics, and visualizing the distribution of the classes and features.

After EDA, the dataset is split into training and testing subsets, with 120 samples for training and 30 samples for testing. Logistic Regression, despite its name, is well-suited for classification tasks. The model is trained on the training set and then evaluated on the testing set.

The evaluation shows that the model perfectly classified all test samples, achieving 100% accuracy. The confusion matrix confirms that every sample from the three classes was correctly predicted. However, such perfect accuracy may be due to the simplicity of the dataset, a relatively small test set, or potential data leakage where some information from the training data might have inadvertently been used during testing.

In conclusion, the project successfully applies Logistic Regression to classify the Iris dataset, achieving flawless results on the test data. While this outcome highlights the well-structured nature of the dataset, it also raises caution regarding the model's generalizability. Future work should include cross-validation, testing with more complex datasets, and verifying data integrity to ensure the model's robustness.
